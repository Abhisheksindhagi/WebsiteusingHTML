# README: Basic HTML Website

## Project Overview

This project is a basic website built using only HTML. It serves as an introduction to structuring a simple webpage, utilizing links between different sections, navigation, and basic content presentation. The website consists of multiple pages, including a homepage, an about section, a contact section, and a services page.

## Structure of the Project

```
Project Folder
│
├── index.html       # The homepage of the website
├── about.html       # A page about the website or business
├── services.html    # A page detailing services offered
├── contact.html     # A contact page
└── README.md        # This README file
```

## Pages Overview

### 1. `index.html` (Homepage)
The homepage serves as the main entry point of the website. It contains navigation links to the other pages, a welcome message, and an overview of the site’s purpose.

#### Structure:
- **Navigation Bar:** Links to About, Services, and Contact pages.
- **Welcome Section:** A brief welcome message.
- **Overview Section:** Short introduction to what the site is about.

### 2. `about.html` (About Page)
This page provides information about the website or the business it represents. It can include details like the history, mission, or purpose of the site.

#### Structure:
- **Navigation Bar:** Links to the Homepage, Services, and Contact pages.
- **About Section:** Text explaining the purpose of the site or the background of the creator/business.

### 3. `services.html` (Services Page)
This page lists the services provided by the business or the purpose of the website. It may use simple HTML elements like lists to structure the content.

#### Structure:
- **Navigation Bar:** Links to the Homepage, About, and Contact pages.
- **Services Section:** List or brief description of the services offered.

### 4. `contact.html` (Contact Page)
The contact page provides ways to get in touch, including a simple contact form. This page is static (no form processing since it's only HTML).

#### Structure:
- **Navigation Bar:** Links to the Homepage, About, and Services pages.
- **Contact Form:** A form where users can input their name, email, and message.

## Navigation
Each page contains a basic navigation bar that links to all the other pages. This allows users to move easily from one page to another.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="about.html">About</a>
  <a href="services.html">Services</a>
  <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Download/Clone the Project**: Download or clone the project folder to your local machine.
2. **Open in Browser**: Open `index.html` in any web browser to start the website.
3. **Navigate**: Use the navigation bar on each page to visit the other sections of the site.

## Notes

- This project uses only HTML (no CSS or JavaScript).
- The structure is deliberately kept simple to illustrate basic linking and navigation.
- This is a static site with no backend functionality (forms are not processed).

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS to style the website.
- Add JavaScript for form validation and interactivity.
- Integrate a backend (PHP, Node.js) to handle form submissions.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to practice building a website using only HTML.
